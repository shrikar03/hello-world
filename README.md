# hello-world
First repository, trying to learn the use of github and how it can be useful for me.
I am a mechanical engineer and I am learning github, from scratch.
I have completed my Master studies in Power and Data engineering, from Hochschule Offenburg.
I am interested in the field of machine learning and I thought that this platform would be of immense use to me.
I am fluent in English and German.
